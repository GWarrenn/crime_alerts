# crime_alerts : An alternative DC Police Alerts

crime_alerts aims to provide DC residents information regarding policing and crime in their neighborhood. 

The DC Metropolitan Police Department has previously used social media to provide this information, but recently made the decision to switch to using Alert DC, a platform managed by the DC Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency, to disseminate information about crimes.

crime_alerts offers residents a more customized approach, offering users the option to widen or narrow the proximity of crimes in the alerts, as well as only receiving notifications for specific crimes. crime_alerts pulls crime data via dc.gov API on a regular basis and sends notifications to users through Amazon's SNS messaging service. 

crime_alerts is made entirely possible thanks to the DC Metropolitan Police Department and the DC Office of the Chief Technology Officer, who provide a live data feed of crime in the district through the DC OpenData Portal, around which this entire application is built.

This application is currently in the on-going development process, but if you are interested in receiving alerts in the future, please contact augustjwarren@gmail.com
